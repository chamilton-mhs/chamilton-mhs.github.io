      Yesterday, All those backups seemed a waste of pay. Now my database has gone away.

      There's not half the files there used to be,
      And there's a milestone hanging over me.
      The system crashed so suddenly. I pushed something wrong, What it was I could not say.

      Now all my data's gone and I long for yesterday-ay-ay-ay.

    <div id="fourth">
      Yesterday,
      The need for back-ups seemed so far away.
      I knew my data was all here to stay,
      Now I believe in yesterday.
